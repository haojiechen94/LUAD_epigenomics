!(Epigenetic heterogeneity differentiates LUAD patient clinical outcomes)[https://github.com/haojiechen94/LUAD_epigenomics/blob/main/images/two_epigenetic_states.png]
A high intertumoral epigenetic heterogeneity is observed across the LUAD H3K27ac profiles. We quantitatively model the intertumoral variability of H3K27ac levels at proximal gene promoters and distal enhancers and propose a new epigenetic classification of LUAD patients. Our classification defines two LUAD subgroups which are highly related to histological subtypes. Group II patients have significantly worse prognosis than group I, which is further confirmed in the public TCGA-LUAD cohort. Differential RNA-seq analysis between group I and group II groups reveals that those genes upregulated in group II group tend to promote cell proliferation and induce cell de-differentiation. We construct the gene co-expression networks and identify group-specific core regulators. Most of these core regulators are linked with group-specific regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers. We further show that CLU is regulated by 3 group I-specific core regulators and works as a novel tumor suppressor in LUAD.
